## AllOne Data Structure (Doubly Linked List Version)

- How much time have I spent, end-to-end? 
    
    **3 hours, 30 minutes**

- What were the trickiest aspects? Where did I lose the most time?

    **Swapping in double linked list and debugging test cases.**

- What are some lessons/insights I gained from this problem?

    **Better understanding of doubly linked list data structures and pointer manipulations.**

- What would I do differently if I had extra time? What’s remaining to improve?

    **Optimize inc and dec operations — they are currently O(n) in the worst case.**

- What did I do well?

    **Understood the task clearly and implemented a working solution without giving up.**

- Did I use any hints?

    **I used one hint in the discussion section, which suggested the task is similar to LRU cache.**


- How difficult was the problem?

    a) Implementing quickly	3

    b) Finding the right approach	5

    c) Overall	10

- Time Complexity

    | Operation       | Time Complexity |
    |-----------------|-----------------|
    | `inc(key)`      | O(n)            |
    | `dec(key)`      | O(n)            |
    |`getMaxKey()`    | O(1)            |
    | `getMinKey()`   | O(1)            |

- Space Complexity 

    **O(k) where k is the numpber of current Nodes in HashMap and Doubly Linked List**
