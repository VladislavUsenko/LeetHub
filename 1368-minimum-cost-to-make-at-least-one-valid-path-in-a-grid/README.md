- How much time have I spent, end-to-end? 
    
    **2 hours, 20 minutes**

- What were the trickiest aspects? Where did I lose the most time?

    **Finding the proper path in 0-1 BFS.**

- What are some lessons/insights I gained from this problem?

    **Better understanding of BFS traveling in a matrix.**

- What would I do differently if I had extra time? Whatâ€™s remaining to improve?

    **Not tried the DFS from end to start solution**

- What did I do well?

    **Understood the task clearly and write a java code.**

- Did I use any hints?

    **I used ChatGPT as an interviewer, and it gave me hints to use 0-1 BFS and store the cost in a matrix.**


- How difficult was the problem?

    a) Implementing quickly	9

    b) Finding the right approach	9

    c) Overall	9

- Time Complexity

    **O(M * N), where N, M are the size of the matrix**

- Space Complexity 

    **O(M * N), where N,M are the size of the count matrix and size of acual path deque in the worst case**
